					<p class="animate wow fadeInUp">Here is a theme for Latex presentations. It is made to look like one of the powerpoint presentation templates provided by Kellogg. A more general theme can be found here.</p>
					<h4 class="animate wow fadeInUp">Changelog and Usage Instructions</h4>
					<ul>
						<li class="animate wow">First, here is the pdf output: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s2wa2g8348tllny/Kellogg_template.pdf?dl=1" target="_blank">Kellogg_template.pdf</a></li>
						<li class="animate wow">The proof environment will not provide you with a standard block and "Proof.". Instead, it will simply say "Sketch of Proof." and skip to the next line.
							If you need the old proof environment, use oldproof. If you need simply "Proof." instead of "Sketch of Proof.",
							with the simple style, use fullproof.  The reason for this change is that I have never seen anyone in Economics present a full
							proof on a presentation, and the equations are often too unwieldy to look pretty in a block anyway.
						</li>
						<li class="animate wow">The default color is purple for the Kellogg theme. It can be changed however, by passing the structure argument as for the inbuilt beamer themes.
						</li>
						<li class="animate wow">You will need to place the files beamerthemeKellogg.sty, NUidentity_white.pdf, and Kellogg_logo_white.pdf in the folder where your tex file is located.
						</li >
						<li class="animate wow">
							The use of Kellogg logo and identity files is governed by university guidelines that can be found here and here.
						</li>
						<li class="animate wow">
							Invoke the theme by using the command \usetheme{Kellogg} in the preamble
						</li>
						<li class="animate wow">
							The second line after the frametitle can be rid of by adding to the preamble<br><code>\def\NoTitleUnderline{}</code>
						</li>
						<li class="animate wow">
							The tex file that generated the output above: Kellogg_template.tex
						</li>
						<li class="animate wow">
							Members of NU/Kellogg community can use the files freely. However, I request that you link directly to this page when distributing these files so that the user does not accidentally violate the NU/Kellogg usage guidelines.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="animate wow fadeInUp">If you have a theme, or have edited this theme to look different, send me an email with the sty file and a link to your website and I'll add it here.</p>
